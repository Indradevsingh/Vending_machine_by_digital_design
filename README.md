# Vending_machine_by_digital_design
The project involved designing a vending machine that could dispense four different products with varying prices and has the additional feature of returning change when a higher denomination coin was inserted. The vending machine only accepts coins of denominations five and ten.

The design of the vending machine was accomplished through the creation of a Finite State Machine (FSM) model, which defined the machine's different states, inputs, and outputs, as well as the transitions between the states. The FSM model was implemented using Verilog code, which defined the different states and their corresponding logic for accepting coins, dispensing products, and returning change.
